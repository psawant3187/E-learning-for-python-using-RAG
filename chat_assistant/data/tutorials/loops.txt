# Python Loops

Loops are used in Python to repeat a block of code multiple times.

## For Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range.

Example:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

This prints numbers 0 through 4.

You can also iterate through lists:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

## While Loop
A while loop continues to run as long as a condition is True.

Example:
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

Be careful of infinite loops! Always make sure the condition becomes False eventually.

## Break and Continue
- **break** stops the loop completely.
- **continue** skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

Example:
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)

This prints 0, 1, 2.
